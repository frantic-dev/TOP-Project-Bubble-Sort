# Bubble Sort in Ruby

This is a solution to the [Bubble Sort project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-bubble-sort) from the Ruby course in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## 🔍 Project Overview

Bubble Sort is a classic sorting algorithm where elements are repeatedly compared and swapped if they are in the wrong order. Though not the most efficient, it's a great way to learn the basics of sorting logic.

## 🧠 What I Did

Implemented a method called `bubble_sort` in Ruby that takes an array and returns a sorted version using the bubble sort technique — without using Ruby’s built-in `#sort` method.

### Example:

```ruby
bubble_sort([4, 3, 78, 2, 0, 2])
# => [0, 2, 2, 3, 4, 78]
```
